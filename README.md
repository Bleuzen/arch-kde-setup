# arch-kde-setup
Post-install scripts for Arch Linux / Manjaro with KDE

This does not install KDE, it assumes it is already installed.

#### Install

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bleuzen/manjaro-kde-setup/master/curl-installer.sh)"
```

Without LibreOffice:
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bleuzen/manjaro-kde-setup/master/curl-installer.sh) --no-office"
```
